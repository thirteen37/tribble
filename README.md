# The Trouble with Tribo

Inspired by [Gimme Friction Baby for
Playdate](https://github.com/notpeter/playdate-friction) which is in turn based
on the SWF game [Gimme Friction
Baby](https://github.com/notpeter/gimme-friction-baby). This one uses the
Playdate in portrait mode while maintaining the optional use of the crank.

Also a reference to the round troublemakers from Star Trek that won't stop
reproducing.
